# Code Refactor Starter Code
On this project I ran into a messy set of code that was confusing for me to read so I ordered the  HTML the best I could and cleaned up so it is easier to read.
I changed some div elements to semantic elements such as nav, section, and main.
the search engine didn't have an id selector so I added to it so the browser will know where to go if the user was to click it.
The structure was a little messed up when using the mobile view, the headers were low so I tried my best for fix it as well as the benefits border spilling over the bottom making it seem bigger than the other sections.
